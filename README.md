# Desirod
Desirod is an open-source platform which enables the design and performing of multisensory decision making experiments in rodents. The Desirod is significantly enhanced by Arduino (an open-source electronic prototyping platform which enables users to create interactive electronic objects), photoelectric sensors, LEDs and speakers. It can be used in a variety of tasks and paradigms that involve two alternative choices. It can be used individually or in combination with other devices such as electrophysiology data acquisition or movement tracking systems. The reduction in design complexity enables end-users without advanced computer programing and electronics skills to use the system in a range of settings. The main aim of designing Desirod is to drive down the cost of doing experiment. We achieved this goal by using low-cost, off-the-shelf and open-source components, making its running costs 99% cheaper than the cost of comparable commercial devices.
